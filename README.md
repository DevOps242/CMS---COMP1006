> Built with Bootstrap on the FronEnd and PHP on the BackEnd with a MySQL Database

### Purpose Of This Application:
> The purpose of this application is to create dynamic content for public pages, to have our PHP server communicate with a MySQL Database to manage and maintain the public interface that the user sees and interacts with.

### What can this Appliaction do:
> This application allows users to create dynamic public content such as pages, with images and changes to the public's page logo all from a central Admin portal.
> On the Admin Portal, admin's can manage users (Edit and Delete other admin users), manage pages( Create, Edit and Delete pages). 

### What stand out about this project: 
> This project allowed me to showcase my Programming skills and my knowledge in PHP, one part that stand out for me in this project is that, I created a simple logging system which captures the appliaction runtime errors or information that is then stored in a log file that is generated on a daily basis on the server (this is all managed by PHP and not the server itself).

### Why we use these technologies:
