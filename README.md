### What stand out about this project: 
> This project allowed me to showcase my Programming skills and my knowledge in PHP, one part that stand out for me in this project is that, I created a simple logging system which captures server errors or information that then is stored in a log file that is generated on a daily basis on the server (this is all managed by PHP and not the server itself).
